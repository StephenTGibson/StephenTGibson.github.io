## Thoughts on future projects
* Should be defined by a question (which the project attempts to answer)
* Answer to the question is not obvious before start of project
* Has the potential to be useful to someone
* Is in an field I find interesting

## Difficulties I have experienced
* Unavailablity of relevant data
* Frustrations with the learning curve

## Areas of interest

### Government spending
* Visualisation of spending, spending over time
* Spending contrasted with public opinion (what people see as the government's priorities)

### Geographic
* Land use
* Land access
* Regenerative farming

### Household energy use against various factors
* Environmental conditions
* Location
* Property value
