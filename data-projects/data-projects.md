# Data Projects
<br>
## Areas of interest/ideas for future projects
### Ideal criteria for projects
* Defined by a question (which the project attempts to answer)
* Answer to the question is not obvious before start of project
* Has the potential to be useful to someone
<br>
<br>### Difficulties I have experienced
* Non-availablity of relevant data
* Frustrations with the learning curve
<br>
<br>### Areas
#### Government spending
* Visualisation of spending, spending over time
* Spending contrasted with public opinion (what people see as the government's priorities)
<br>
<br>#### Land use and access
* Regenerative farming
<br>
