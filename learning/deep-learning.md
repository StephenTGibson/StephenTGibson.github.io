Working my way through some online Kaggle courses, they provide a good basic understanding of concepts and techniques in the data science field

* Deep learning is a field of machine learning which uses particularly _deep_ stacks of calculations
* Most widespread technique in deep learning is use of _neural networks_
* In this case, each neuron constitutes a (generally simple) calculation
* These calculations are arranged in multiple layers;
* Inputs passed to 1st layers;
* Each layers' outputs passed to next layer;
* Final layers' outputs goes into delivering final output
* The input passed from one neuron to next has an associated _weight_
* The learning process of the model involves modifying the various weights across the whole model
