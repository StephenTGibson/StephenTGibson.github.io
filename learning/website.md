# Intro
When I decided to make a website I was keen to remind myself that it only needs to be simple and informative to be effective. 
- not wanting to dedicate too much time to learning all sorts of fancy css and 

made my mistakes...
Even so, I found I needed to learn quite a few different things in order to produce this site. 

I'm sure a lot of these are very basic and obious to a lot of peolple, but hopefully they will be useful to someone

### Naming
It's definitely a good idea to name your images something sensible
I've read this can be good for search engines and all that stuff, but it also just makes your own life easier

### Resolution
Initially I thought it was best to resize my images before uploading as this would keep the file sizes to a minimum. However I quickly realied that you are going to lose out in quality that way. 

I wanted a small image for the introduction section of my adventures page, so I used: <br>
<img src="/images/learning/website/resolution-300x225.jpg" alt = '300 by 225 pixel image of me sitting down on a hill'/> <br>
Which is 300 x 255 pixels and 22KB file size, pretty clearly not great quality

It seems that would I should actually do is resize the image first to bring it to a more manageable file size, then resize it again to the size I want on my page. As a demonstration, for my own sake as much as yours, here is a photo of me having a sit down in several different resolutions, with associated file size <br>

###### Original image - 4000x3000 - 3.5MB <br>
<img width="400" src="/images/learning/website/resolution-4000x3000.jpg" alt = '4000 by 3000 pixel image of me sitting down on a hill'/>
<br>

###### 2000x1875 - 820KB <br>
<img width="400" src="/images/learning/website/resolution-2000x1500.jpg" alt = '2000 by 1500 pixel image of me sitting down on a hill'/>
<br>

###### 1000x750 - 224KB <br>
<img width="400" src="/images/learning/website/resolution-1000x750.jpg" alt = '1000 by 750 pixel image of me sitting down on a hill'/>
<br>

###### 500x375 - 224KB <br>
<img width="400" src="/images/learning/website/resolution-500x375.jpg" alt = '500 by 375 pixel image of me sitting down on a hill'/>
<br>

###### Initial resized image, displayed at 400 px wide for comparison - 300x255 - 22KB <br>
<img width="400" src="/images/learning/website/resolution-300x225.jpg" alt = '300 by 225 pixel image of me sitting down on a hill'/>
