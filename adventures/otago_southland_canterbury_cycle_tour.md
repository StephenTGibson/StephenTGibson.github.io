A full and busy 2 weeks. Definitely challenging. I struggled with big tough hot days towards the start and scared myself a bit with hgihway traffic between Roxburgh and Alex. Slowing down, enjoying it and having a relaxing time with my partner reinvigorated me. The last 4 days were especially good; varied, still some challenges like Dansey's Pass and the hot ride to Kurow, with some added history interest along the rail trail. Definitely know some of these places a lot better now. The chance social encounters were also particularly enjoyable.

Tough but rewarding. Always good to not be afraid of changing plans and adapting as the situation evolves. The trip was a success because I got out there and did it. Certainly learnt a lot in the process and appreciating that now makes it all the richer.
