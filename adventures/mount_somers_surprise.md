title: A Snowy Surprise at Mount Somers
---

During my first period travelling in New Zealand I was lucky enough to spend a few weeks as a volunteer hut warden between the two huts of the Mount Somers Walkway. I was keen to return after a few years to explore the area again

###### Day 1 

We walked the short track up to Pinnacles hut from the eastern end of the walkway and left our overnight kit there. We could then continue up towards the saddle for an explore with minimal baggage. Cloud was moving in across the plains and the hut was enveloped but it never rose further up the valley.

From the saddle we scrambled steeply up to the Mount Somers plateau. From there we could cross to the summit itself.

I enjoy the rocky and tussock colours of the plateau and we had some good views to the west, up the Ashburton basin.

Moving westwards off the plateau to hook up with the main track, we descended gentle tussock slopes as the clouds thickened above and below.

We descended into the cloud to meet the track.

Turning north on the track, we cross this swing bridge and soon reach Woolshed Creek hut. I spent much of my wardening time in this area.

From the hut the cloud is thickening but the track back up over the saddle and down to Pinnacles is well marked and easy going. With only small packs we make quick time and get back to Pinnacles for dinner just as a steady rain sets in.

###### Day 2

The evening rain had persisted into the night. I remember waking sometime in the early morning before light and thinking it must have stopped as I could no longer hear it falling on the roof. You can imagine our surprise when we saw in daylight that it had in fact turned to snow and come down heavily through the night.

It was still falling in big flakes as we set off back down to the road end.

What a change from the day before!

Considering how much had fallen at the hut, it could have been slow going for anyone attempting to cross the saddle that morning, at least without snowshoes.

We were happy to enjoy the spectacle as we made our way back down to the road end. The amount hanging off the trees and bushes was impressive, causing them to bend under the load.

The day felt relatively warm and it must have been just on the temperature limit for snow to fall. The snow continued, heavy and wet.

As we descended further, the depth of snow lying decreased quickly.

By the time we neared the road end, it was just another soggy spring day.

I believe the snow didn't last long after this fall as the temperature continued to rise through the afternoon. It was a real added bonus for the weekend. Wrapped up warm as we were, the landscape's overnight transformation into a winter wonderland was pretty special.
