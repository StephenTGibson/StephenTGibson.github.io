### [Fiordland - The Hollyford](/adventures/fiordland_the_hollyford.html)
###### August 2021
Originally planned to attempt an FKT on the Hollyford and Pyke loop. Foiled by Fiordland weather, we instead retraced our steps back up the Hollyford

### [Kaikoura - Hapuku Valley and Mt Fyffe](/adventures/kaikoura_hapuku_valley_and_mt_fyffe.html)
###### May 2021
A 4 day hike near Kaikoura as part of a week long holiday in the area. Interesting to see lots of evidence remaining of the 2016 earthquake

### [Fiordland - U, Glade and Dore Passes](/adventures/fiordland_u_glade_dore.html)
###### March 2021
A 3 day tramp a long time in the planning, traversing 3 passes in northern Fiordland. Being mostly off-track, this was a good challenge. We enjoyed almost perfect weather, making this a very rewarding adventure

### [Otago, Southland and Canterbury Cycle Tour](/adventures/otago_southland_canterbury_cycle_tour.html)
###### February 2021
2 weeks cycle touring in the southern south island. I designed the route to combine as many of the New Zealand cycle trails in the area as possible. I was particularly impressed by the amount of historical information available on my route through trailside boards and exhibits. The enjoyment I got from learning about the history of the places I passed through was an unexpected bonus for the trip

### [A Snowy Surprise at Mount Somers](/adventures/mount_somers_surprise.html)
###### November 2020
A weekend explore of Mount Somers in Canterbury. We woke on Sunday morning to a surprise overnight snowfall

### [Ohau - Temple Stream, Maitland and Freehold Creeks Loop](/adventures/ohau_temple_maitland_freehold.html)
###### February 2020
4 days sunny camping in the mountains north west of Lake Ohau. A mixture of beautiful alpine streams, barren rocky landscapes and high mountain lakes
