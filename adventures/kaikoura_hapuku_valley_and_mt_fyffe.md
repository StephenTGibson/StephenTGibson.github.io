title: Kaikoura - Hapuku Valley and Mt Fyffe
---

The first day we walked up the Hapuku river bed and took the west branch to Hapuku Hut. 

The following morning we backtracked to the confluence and took the north branch. As a result of the 2016 earthquake, a large amount of rock had collapsed from Surveyor Spur. A large part of the debris has formed a natural rock dam in the upper Hapuku. This has backed up the river and formed a small lake. We were keen to investigate and see some of this for oursleves.

Since the lake formed, the natural outflow has cut a notch in the dam wall and much of the water has been released. This makes visiting the lake much safer. There remains a small glacial lake behind the dam, which was sufficient for a very brief and refreshing swim.

The following morning it was only a few hours steeply down the 4wd track to finish

###### Whale Watching
Following the hike, we spent a few days exploring the peninsula and took a whale watching tour. We were lucky enough to see 2 of the local resident Sperm Whales
