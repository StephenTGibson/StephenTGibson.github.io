<h2>Backcountry Christmas</h2>

<p>Being with family is a key part of Christmas for me. At some point previously, there was a chance that I might have been at home in the UK for this Christmas. However with Covid-19 and the myriad -
associated complications it was apparent that that was unlikely from a long way out.</p>

<p>Instead of staying home and missing family for Christmas, I spent Christmas with 3 friends also from overseas and facing similar travel difficulties. 
We headed up to the Kahurangi National Park in the north west of the south island, as an area well outside our range of weekend trips from Dunedin, for 6 days of tramping.</p>
